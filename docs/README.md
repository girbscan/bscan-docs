# BSCAN Guide

## 1. The Birth of BSCAN

Since the launch of OpenAI’s foundational models, capital and tech giants around the world have quickly recognized the immense potential of AI and have been actively building their presence in the AI sector.

Today, AI technologies have already permeated all aspects of daily life and work, from intelligent search engines to AI-powered programming, AI video generation, and more. Without a doubt, AI is already reshaping human life today and will lead humanity into a brand-new era dominated by AI technologies.

However, the current stage of AI development remains relatively early, comparable to the internet era of the 1990s. For AI to drive widespread changes in human life, there is still a huge need for foundational infrastructure buildout.

Among this infrastructure, two critical elements stand out: the massive computational power required for training large AI models, and the development of AI frameworks that allow everyday developers to easily build various AI applications. According to leading U.S. research institutions, the market opportunity from building these foundational layers is estimated to exceed trillions of dollars, making it an essential driver for AI’s mass adoption.

BSCAN was created to address these two critical needs for AI’s large-scale application.

BSCAN is deployed on the BNB Chain, leveraging blockchain’s transparency, fairness, and immutability to ensure that every individual or team contributing compute power to AI model training has their efforts permanently recorded on-chain, and receives corresponding rewards. Additionally, every large model creator can use BSCAN to mint their own Large Model Token (LMT) and design a customized token economy around it.

The second major goal of BSCAN is to become an AI framework suitable for various types of AI Agents. Any developer can use BSCAN to create their own AI applications, such as an AI Agent focused on financial data analysis, an AI Agent dedicated to industrial automation, a work consulting AI Agent, a quantitative trading AI Agent, and more. These AI Agents can also create their own tokens and token economies through BSCAN.



## 2. Specific Applications of BSCAN

BSCAN is a revolutionary AI framework that combines blockchain technology with the construction of various AI models.

### The most immediate product built on BSCAN is DeFi AI (DeFAI).

Through the built-in tools of the BSCAN AI framework, the following on-chain products can be created:

1. &#x20;AI Agents for intelligent analysis of complex on-chain data
2. &#x20;AI Agents for smart trading, predicting market trends by learning strategies and market data
3. &#x20;AI Agents that complete complex on-chain operations and fulfill various on-chain demands based on instructions

As long as developers are willing, they can use BSCAN to create a wide range of on-chain intelligent products.

### Gaming Sector

1. &#x20;Intelligent game creation, assisting developers in completing game development easily
2. AI game players, using AI to replace human players according to gameplay needs
3. Smart game strategy generation, providing intelligent strategies for players

AI Agents for various game-related needs can be created based on BSCAN.

### Intelligent Robots

Language robots based on LLM models

Industrial AI brains for coordinating industrial production

And various other types of industrial AI Agents.

### AIspace

AIspace is a blockchain-based AI investment assistant built on BSCAN. It can monitor abundant blockchain data and information from various social platforms in real time, helping users analyze industry trends, find opportunities, and avoid risks.



## 3. BSCAN Token Design

The token symbol for BSCAN is BSCAN, with a maximum supply of 2.5 billion tokens, and no team allocation or reserve.

In BSCAN, 350 million tokens are issued through the PUMP system, created entirely by smart contracts.

The remaining supply will be generated through mining.

### PUMP Issuance

PUMP issuance uses a bonding curve model.The earlier the purchase, the lower the price; as issuance progresses, the price increases steadily. From the start to the end of PUMP issuance, BSCAN’s price can rise by approximately 13 times.

Conditions for ending PUMP issuance: 1.All 350 million BSCAN are sold out, or 2.The issuance period reaches 6 months (180 days), issuance ends when either condition is met.

After issuance ends, all USDT and the calculated amount of BSCAN in PUMP will be injected into a Uniswap liquidity pool based on the final BSCAN/USDT transaction price at the end of issuance.

Each transaction during the PUMP issuance phase incurs a 1% transaction fee.The project team does not charge any other fees, all USDT collected in PUMP will be used for liquidity provision.

### PUMP Bonding Curve Formula

K = x \* y = ( x + dx ) \* ( y - dy );

x=8,000,000, y=490,000,000; dx = Total USDT amount bought or sold，dy= Total BSCAN amount bought or sold

&#x20;

## 4. Mining

Go to bscan.ai, enter the mining page, and activate mining by entering an invitation code.

Mining officially begins from the moment BSCAN is issued via PUMP.

Mining includes holding BSCAN for mining and inviting others for mining.

### Holding BSCAN for Mining

After linking a wallet and purchasing a certain amount of BSCAN through PUMP, users can activate daily mining tasks to start mining BSCAN.

The mined BSCAN can be sold for USDT within PUMP.

### Mining Tiers

Holding 50U ≤ BSCAN < 200U: Primary Tier, can only mine for 10 days, with a 3% yield over 10 days. Daily mining task time: 10 minutes.

Holding 200U ≤ BSCAN < 1000U: Advanced Tier, mining is available throughout the PUMP issuance period, with a monthly yield of 12%. Daily mining task time: 5 minutes.

Holding BSCAN ≥ 1000U: Super Tier, mining is available throughout the PUMP issuance period, with a monthly yield of 15%. Daily mining task time: 2 minutes.

Mining rewards are calculated by block and settled daily at 24:00 (UTC).

After PUMP issuance ends, all USDT in the PUMP pool will be added to the BSCAN/USDT liquidity pool on Uniswap.

BSCAN purchased through PUMP will be released gradually by block over 6 months. Mining can continue during the release period.

After the PUMP phase ends, users can purchase BSCAN from Uniswap or other exchanges and deposit into the mining contract. Mining tiers and yield rules remain the same. The difference is that each deposit allows for mining over a 6-month period, with the principal released by block over 6 months. Mining will stop once the release is complete. Primary Tier still only allows mining for 10 days.

During the mining period, if the BSCAN price drops or BSCAN is withdrawn, causing the holding value to drop below the corresponding tier requirement, the mining tier will be downgraded accordingly.

### Invite Mining

Advanced Tier and Super Tier users can participate in invite mining.

Advanced Tier users can receive 10% mining rewards from first-level invitees and 8% rewards from second-level invitees. (If the first-level invitee is Primary or Super Tier, only the first-level reward can be received.)

Super Tier users, in addition to receiving 10% first-level and 8% second-level rewards (if the first-level invitee is Primary Tier, only first-level reward can be received), can also receive Super Rewards. (If any level is below Super Tier, Super Rewards will terminate at that level.)

Invite mining rewards are calculated by block and settled daily at 24:00 (UTC).

Invite mining rules remain unchanged after the PUMP phase ends.

### Selling Mining Rewards

All mining rewards can be sold, including rewards from holding BSCAN and from invite mining.

During the PUMP issuance phase, users can directly sell BSCAN for USDT in the PUMP pool. Upon selling, 3% of the mined BSCAN will be burned (sent to black hole), 2% will be charged as a project service fee, and the remaining 95% will be exchanged for USDT.

After PUMP ends, users can withdraw their mining rewards and sell them on Uniswap or other exchanges. Upon withdrawal, 3% will be burned, 2% will be charged as a project service fee, and the remaining 95% will be transferred to the user's address.

## 5. BSCAN Ecosystem

BSCAN is a revolutionary AI framework built by combining blockchain technology with various AI models. Based on BSCAN, AI Agents serving different industries can be created.

For example, DeFAI AI Agent focusing on DeFi, GAME AI Agent focusing on gaming, and Smart Manufacturing AI Agent focusing on intelligent manufacturing.

Currently, AISPACE is a DeFAI AI Agent product developed based on BSCAN, positioned as a blockchain AI investment assistant. It can monitor extensive blockchain data and information from various social platforms in real-time, helping users analyze industry trends, identify opportunities, and avoid risks. The product is still being refined and optimized.

In the future, it is expected that tens of thousands of AI Agent applications will emerge within the BSCAN ecosystem. Each AI Agent will require BSCAN tokens for creation. These tokens will be injected into the mining pool for users to continue mining BSCAN.

If these AI Agents issue their own tokens, users will also be able to use BSCAN to mine.

The BSCAN platform will charge a service fee from these AI Agents. This fee will become the revenue of the BSCAN platform. BSCAN will use this revenue to repurchase BSCAN tokens.
